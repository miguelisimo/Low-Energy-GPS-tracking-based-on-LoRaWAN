# Low-Energy-GPS-tracking-based-on-LoRaWAN

Diploma Project 2018/19

Low-Energy-GPS-tracking-based-on-LoRaWAN is an IoT infrastructure for the energy-saving transmission of IoT sensor data (GPS, temperature, humidity, etc.). This infrastructure also includes a web application that visualizes the measurement and GPS data on a local website via a dashboard. In addition, this web application consists of a bot that independently and continuously publishes measurement data via a Twitter account. Account subscribers can therefore receive the latest data collection as a notification directly on their end devices.
